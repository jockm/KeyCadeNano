Writing programs for the KeyCade Nano
=====================================

*TL;DR I just want [A quick tutorial on writing your own programs](WritingYourProgram.md)*

While it would be possible to write new programs and games to the KeyCade Nano by forking the repository and modifying the code, this would not be the preferred approach .

Instead the KeyCade Nano supports a handful of interpreters and virtual machines to allow you to write in different languages:

* [EmbedVM](EmbedVM.md) — The game engine you probably want to use
* [CHIP-8](CHIP-8.md) — If you are into the 
  [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) scene
* [uBASIC](uBASIC.md) — If you really really must, use the tiniest basic around...but you probably don't.

Once you have picked the endine you want to use, you need to understand the [concepts common](Common..md) to all engines; and what [Useful tools](UsefulTools.md) to help you,

Once you have written your program you will need to put it on a [Cartridge](Cartridge.md].
