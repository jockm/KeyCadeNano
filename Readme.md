There really needs to be more text here


Limitations & Future Plans
--------------------------
Not all [S]CHIP-8 programs are known to work.  Some require the full 16-key 
keyboard, and as such will never be able to work on the hardware as it 
currently is.  Others fail for as yet undetermined reasons, such as the game
_Ant_.  

Currently all game engines are limited to 4K of executable code.  While this
is (more than) enough for many types games, but people will always want more.
While the hardware currently 64K of SRAM, future editions — should they ever
exist — are likely to support much less. So we are sticking with this number 
for now.  You are free to expand this as you see fit.

There is no persistant storage, no way of saving games, high scores, or the 
like.  In the future a portion of cartridge space may be put aside for app
based storage.
